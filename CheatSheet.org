* Categories

A *category* ùíû consists of a collection of ‚Äúobjects‚Äù ~Obj ùíû,~ a collection of
  ‚Äúmorphisms‚Äù ~Mor ùíû~, an operation ~Id~ associating a morphism ~Id‚Çê : a ‚Üí a~ to each object ~a~,
  a parallel pair of functions ~src, tgt : Mor ùíû ‚Üí Obj ùíû~, and a ‚Äúcomposition‚Äù
  operation ~_Ôπî_ : ‚àÄ{A B C : Obj} ‚Üí (A ‚Üí B) ‚Üí (B ‚Üí C) ‚Üí (A ‚Üí C)~
  where for objects ~X~ and ~Y~ we define the /type/ ~X ‚Üí Y~
  as follows
\begin{flalign*}
    f : X \to Y \quad\equiv\quad \mathsf{src}\; f = X \;\land\; \mathsf{tgt}\; f = Y 
   &&
   \tag*{defn-Type}
   \label{defn-Type}
\end{flalign*}
# For other approaches see https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/12035/69371
#
# As we can see from \eqref{defn-Type}\ldots
#
  Moreover composition is required to be associative with ~Id~ as identity.

Instead of ~src~ and ~tgt~ we can instead assume primitive a ternary relation
~_:_‚Üí_~ and regain the operations precisely when the relation is functional
in its last two arguments:
\eqn{unique-Type}{f : A \to B \;\land\; f : A' \to B' \;\implies\; A=A' \;\land\; B=B'}
When this condition is dropped, we obtain a /pre-category/; e.g., the familiar /Sets/
is a pre-category that is usually treated as a category by making morphisms
contain the information about their source and target: ~(A, f, B) : A ‚Üí B~
rather than just ~f~.

\vspace{1em}

A categorical statement is an expression built from notations for objects,
typing, morphisms, composition, and identities by means of the usual logical
connectives and quantifications and equality.

\vspace{1em}

Even when morphisms are functions, the objects need not be sets:
Sometimes the objects are /operations/ --with an appropriate definition
of typing for the functions. The categories of F-algebras are an example
of this.

Example Categories.
+ Each digraph determines a category: The objects are the nodes
  and the paths are the morphisms typed with their starting and ending node.
  Composition is catenation of paths and identity is the empty path.
+ Each preorder determines a category: The objects are the elements
  and there is a morphism ~a ‚Üí b~ named, say, ~(a, b),~ precisely when $a ‚â§ b$.
